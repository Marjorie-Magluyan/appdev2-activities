Better project planning, including a comprehensive requirement analysis and realistic plans, might have helped to reduce our project's delays and difficulties. Effective scope management to regulate modifications and prevent scope creep would have also been beneficial. Appropriate resource allocation and balanced workloads are critical, as are agile approaches for iterative development and ongoing feedback. 
Comprehensive testing methodologies, effective bug tracking, and prioritization are critical. Regular risk assessments and mitigation measures should be implemented, along with open interaction with stakeholders and excellent team collaboration using technological advances such as Jira. A post-mortem study following milestones to learn from successes and mistakes is critical for continued development in future projects.
